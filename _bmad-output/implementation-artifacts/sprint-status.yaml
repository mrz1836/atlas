# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
#
# CRITICAL WORKFLOW RULES (Enforced):
# ===================================
# 1. dev-story workflow MUST set status to 'review' (NOT 'done') after implementation
# 2. ONLY the code-review workflow can transition a story from 'review' to 'done'
# 3. Stories CANNOT skip the 'review' status - this is a mandatory checkpoint
# 4. If dev-story sets status to 'done', this is a workflow violation - revert to 'review'
# 5. Pre-commit validation (go-pre-commit run --all-files) is REQUIRED before review
#
# VALIDATION CHECKLIST (Before marking 'done'):
# =============================================
# [ ] All acceptance criteria verified with code evidence
# [ ] All tests pass with race detection (magex test:race)
# [ ] Linting passes (magex lint)
# [ ] Pre-commit hooks pass (go-pre-commit run --all-files)
# [ ] Code review completed by different agent/session
# [ ] Story file updated with Dev Agent Record and completion notes
