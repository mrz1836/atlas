# ATLAS
> **Adaptive Teamwork Layer for AI Systems**

---

Imagine waking up to find your backlog lighter.

Not because you worked late—because someone else did. Someone who never loses context. Someone who remembers every architectural decision, every edge case, every lesson learned across every project you've ever touched together.

**ATLAS is that someone.**

---

This isn't another AI assistant that spits out boilerplate and leaves you to clean up.

ATLAS is a virtual senior developer. It plugs into your existing workflow—Asana, Linear, GitHub Projects—and does the work.

Investigate. Propose. Wait for approval. Implement. Validate. Open the PR. Wait for review.

The loop closes. The code ships.

---

At every critical junction, ATLAS stops and asks.

It doesn't guess. It doesn't cut corners. It doesn't ship code without validation.

**You keep the wheel. ATLAS carries the weight.**
