_You know the drill._

Fix the bug. Run the linter. Run the tests. Fix what the linter found. Run them again. Write the commit message. Push. Open the PR. Fill out the description. Wait.

Repeat forever.

**ATLAS handles the tedium so you can focus on the craft.**

A CLI tool that orchestrates AI-assisted SDD workflows for Go projects. You describe what needs doing. ATLAS analyzes, implements, validates, and delivers—pausing at every decision point for your approval.

Work on multiple features in parallel. Let CI finish before you review. Stay in control.

At every checkpoint that matters, ATLAS stops and waits.

**You keep the wheel. ATLAS carries the weight.**
