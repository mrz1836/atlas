Generate a pull request title and body for the following changes.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Title MUST follow conventional commits format: <type>(<scope>): <description>
   - Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore, build, ci
   - Scope is optional but recommended (derived from changed files/packages)
   - Description should be concise (50 chars max)

2. Body MUST contain these exact sections (with ## headers):
   ## Summary
   Brief description of what changes were made and why.

   ## Changes
   List of changed files with brief descriptions.

   ## Test Plan
   How the changes were tested/validated.

ACCURACY:
3. Base your description on the actual commit messages and diff content provided below
4. Be accurate and specific about what actually changed

OUTPUT FORMAT - CRITICAL:
5. TITLE: must appear FIRST, followed by title text on the same line
6. BODY: must appear on a SEPARATE line AFTER the title
7. Do NOT include any text before TITLE: or after the body content
8. Do NOT use markdown code blocks around your response

EXACT FORMAT (follow this precisely):
TITLE: <type>(<scope>): <description>
BODY:
## Summary
<summary text>

## Changes
<changes list>
